# Why Use Vite for React
1. Vite improves the dev server start time.
2. It has a quick and responsice development experience with the help of **Hot Module Replacement** (HMR).

## Technologies Behind Vite
1. Uses **esbuild**, which is written in go. It pre-bundles dependencies much **faster** than JavaScript-based bundlers.
2. Uses **Rollup** as the bundler. The reason Vite uses **Rollup** because it offers a better **performance** and **flexibility** tradeoff.
